# Iteration Assessment

1. Fork
1. Clone
1. `cd` into the repo
1. run `mocha`
1. Write your code, add, commit

__RUNNING TESTS:__

* RED - watch a test fail, read the error message
* GREEN - write the code to pass the test
* REFACTOR - Ask yourself if you can do it better. Cleaner code. Well named functions and variables.

__YOU SHOULD COMPLETE THESE IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER__

1. `reverse.js`
1. `sum_columns.js`
1. `transpose.js`
1. `nested_objects_arrays.js`

You should work through tests one at a time. When you have passed the first test,
delete the `x` from the next `xit` statement and run the tests again.

Rinse and repeat until all tests are passing.

__NOTE: DO NOT PUSH UNTIL INSTRUCTED TO DO SO BY YOUR INSTRUCTOR__
